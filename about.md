Hi, my name is David Seah. I am currently working as a software engineer dealing with graphics rendering in the automotive industry. 

I believe in making things that are useful and that it brings value to peopleâ€™s life.  

I want to make use of this blog to showcase some of the work that I have done, and also to write about what I have learned.
