![David Seah]({{ site.github.url }}/images/{{ davidseah.jpg }}){:class="img-responsive"}

My name is David Seah. I am a Software Engineer. 
I graduated from Digipen Insitute of Technology with a Bachelor degree in Computer Science in Real Time interactive Simulation.

I believe in the value of creating things. If I were to be born a thousand years ago, I will see myself as a carpenter. 
Now through software, it is so much easier to create things that potentially benfit thousands and millions of people.

I want to improve myself everyday. I want to make use of this blog to improve myself. 

I wrote mainly in C++ and I am currently learning Vulkan. I also have an interest in front end development.
