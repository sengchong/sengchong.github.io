Hi everyone! My name is David Seah. I am currently working as a Software Engineer in Continental Automotive. 

### More Information
I have created this technical blog to share my knowledge. Also this will be a great way to learn and document new things that I have learned.
Hopefully this will improve not only improve my technical skills but also my communication skills. 

My main programming language is C/C++ (Mostly C++). I am using it mostly in my day job. I have learned and used C/C++ since 2011. However when I first started learned it still c++98 and not C++11.
I am currently trying to learned and master c++11.So I will cover some of the topics about C++11 over here. 

Some of my interests are graphics programming, game programming and recently web/app programming. I have picked up C# while using unity engine. For scripting I used mostly python. 
I am currently learning Ruby on Rails and R programming. 

###Disclaimer
Most of the contents will not original, most likely I have learned or read it somewhere but would like to share it using my own words.
