Hi everyone! My name is David Seah. I am currently working as a Software Engineer in Continental Automotive. 

### More Information
I have created this blog to share my knowledge with people that shares the similar interest with me. I have always enjoy writing and sharing of new thngs that I have learned. 

I am currenty working as a graphics programmer in the automotive industry. My work requires me to work with building a graphics API and tools. Mostly I used C/C++ in my job. I have learned and used C/C++ since 2011. However when I first started learned it still c++98 and not C++11. I am currently trying to learned and master c++11.So I will cover some of the topics about C++11 over here. Some of my interests are graphics programming, game programming and recently web/app programming. I have picked up C# while using unity engine. For scripting I used mostly python. I am currently learning swift, Ruby on Rails and R programming. 

I like building things. And I hope that the things that I build will make people's life better. 

###Disclaimer
Most of the contents will not original, most likely I have learned or read it somewhere but would like to share it using my own words.
