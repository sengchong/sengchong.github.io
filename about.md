My name is David Seah. I am a Software Engineer. 
I graduated from Digipen Insitute of Technology with a Bachelor degree in Computer Science in Real Time interactive Simulation.

My life mission is to create things that bring values to people life. I believe that I am born with the ability to create and improve the life of people. 
I believe in the value of creating things. I believe in the making things that improve the life of people.
I see myself as a craftmans. If I were to be born a thousand years ago, I will see myself as a carpenter. 
Now through software, it is so much easier to create things that potentially benfit thousands and millions of people.

As a craftsman, I want to improve myself everyday. I will make use of this blog to documents my learnings. 
I wrote mainly in C++ and I am currently learning Vulkan. I also have an interest in front end development.
