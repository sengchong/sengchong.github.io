title: Writing a technical blog	
---

In 2012, I wrote my first online blog. That was before blogging was called blogging.(We called it an online journal?) And then came blogger, where one could easily write things online without needing to go through the complexity of setting up a website. 

I too, have a couple of blogs. In my previous blogs, I mostly shared about my day to day life, my thoughts and random rants. I enjoyed writing and sharing my thoughts. I remember how much I looked forward to people leaving comments on my posts. However, writing online also meant that I am exposing myself to people that I don't know, or worse still, people who I know but became offended by the stuff that I wrote. For this reason, I stopped sharing my blogs and eventually without anyone reading them, there was no motivation in writing them anymore. 

 Instead of random sharing, I thought, why not create a blog for technical stuff? I can use it as a platform to learn and share things, and hopefully create conversations or even a community of like-minded people.
