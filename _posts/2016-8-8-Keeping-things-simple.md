It's hard writing a technical blog as compared to a personal blog. First, there must be some form of research needs to be done. Also unlike a personal blog, which is never right or wrong, just a matter of preference, a technical blog has to be correct. Also what you mention might be already discussed somewhere. I believe there are only 0.0.01% of possible new content. 

So what's make your technical blog so special? 
I think unlike a thesis, it has to be fun. Maybe somehow a hybrid between a personal blog and a thesis? This make things more fun right?

Also I think there is a tendency of showing your finial product. Who wants to show people that flaws and stupidity right? Everyone wants to be shown a good side of them. But that would be boring right? After all life is about a taking baby steps and moving into a bigger picture.   

I had recently read about Jeremy Kun blog articles. https://jeremykun.com/ and https://medium.com/@jeremyjkun.

In one of his article, he said that he uses his blog to learn about new concepts in mathematics that he may find it useful in future, or he may reconginse in his research that some of his skills like probabiity skills are weak and use his blog as a way to improve this skills. I think I too will attempt to do something like what he do. Using a blog, is a good way to keep motivation high. It doesn't has to be prefect. End of the day, the blog is meant to improve my skills and to help me to learn than to write for a specific target audiences.
