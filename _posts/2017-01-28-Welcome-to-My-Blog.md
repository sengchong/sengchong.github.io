Hi! Welcome to my blog! This will be a short post as I have just updated the about page.
If you want to know more about me, you can go to the about page to check it up. =) 
I will be using this blog to write about things that I have learned. It may be technical or non-technical.
My aim is to be better in my craft, which is software development by learning new things as much as I can. 
Also, I will try to have as much as I can on this platform and not see this as work.
Pardon me if I make any mistakes. 
Hope to see you around!
