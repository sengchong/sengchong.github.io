title: Representing vectors in computer graphics
---

In mathematics to define a point or a vector we will usually do it in the form of $p$ = ($x$, $y$, $z$).This means: <br/>

 <center> $$x \cdot \hat{i} + y \cdot \hat{j} + z \cdot \hat{k} $$  </center> <br/>

However this is not good enough as we need a way to differentiate between a point and a vector in our program. 
Therefore we need to add in an extra component, the origin. <br/><br/>
<center>$x$ $\cdot$ $\hat{i}$ + $y$ $\cdot$ $\hat{j}$ + $z$ $\cdot$ $\hat{k}$ + 1 $\cdot$ $\omicron$ </center>

This can be also represented in
