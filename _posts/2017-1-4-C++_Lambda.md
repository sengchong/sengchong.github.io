Happy New year! I have started this blog last year with the aim of writing more technical article. 
However the fear of not coming out with a perfect article prevented me from doing so. 
So this year, I have set myself a goal that I am going to write one techincal article everyweek. 
I am not looking for a polish article but rather a habit of just keep publishing. 
I the aim is to build myself a reputation outside of my work. 

Currently I am working on a Vulkan graphic engine using C++11. 
And I stumbled upon a site that was using lamda. While I have use lamda before, the usecase is trivial. 
So I thought why not I study deeper into it and write my first article of the year about it?
Win win situation. =)
