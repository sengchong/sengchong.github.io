title: Writing a technical blog	2
---
It's hard writing a technical blog as compared to a personal blog. First, there must be some form of research needs to be done. Also unlike a personal blog, which is never right or wrong, just a matter of preference, a technical blog has to be correct. Also what you mention might be already discussed somewhere. I believe there are only 0.0.01% of possible new content. 

So what's make your technical blog so special? 
I think unlike a thesis, it has to be fun. Maybe somehow a hybrid between a personal blog and a thesis? This make things more fun right?

Also I think there is a tendency of showing your finial product. Who wants to show people that flaws and stupidity right? Everyone wants to be shown a good side of them. But that would be boring right? After all life is about a taking baby steps and moving into a bigger picture.
