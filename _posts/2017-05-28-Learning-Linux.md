I have started learning Linux at work as I need to compile my project for a new hardware. 

I took this opportunity to challenge myself to learn things that I do not know. I believe in having a growth mentally. What I cannot do today, does not means that I cannot do tomorrow. 

Yes, it might be true that I might be slower than others, but as long as I continue to persevere, I will be able to improve and be better.

So for the first couple of weeks, I am trying out and learning different things. Today I had my first breakthrough. I managed to get my hardware running.
